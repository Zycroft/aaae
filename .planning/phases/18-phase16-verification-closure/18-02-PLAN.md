<objective>
Update REQUIREMENTS.md to mark ORCH-01 through ORCH-07 as complete, closing the v1.5 milestone audit gap

Purpose: With 16-VERIFICATION.md confirming all 7 ORCH requirements satisfied (produced in Plan 18-01), update the formal traceability document to reflect this. This converts 7 partial requirements to satisfied, bringing v1.5 to 25/25 complete.

Output: Updated `.planning/REQUIREMENTS.md` with all ORCH checkboxes checked and status set to Complete.

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Check ORCH-01–07 boxes and update traceability table to Complete</name>
  <files>.planning/REQUIREMENTS.md</files>
  <action>
    Read `.planning/REQUIREMENTS.md` first. Then make the following targeted edits:

    **Section: Orchestration (lines with ORCH-01 through ORCH-07)**

    Change each of the 7 unchecked requirement lines from `- [ ]` to `- [x]`:
    - `- [ ] **ORCH-01**:` → `- [x] **ORCH-01**:`
    - `- [ ] **ORCH-02**:` → `- [x] **ORCH-02**:`
    - `- [ ] **ORCH-03**:` → `- [x] **ORCH-03**:`
    - `- [ ] **ORCH-04**:` → `- [x] **ORCH-04**:`
    - `- [ ] **ORCH-05**:` → `- [x] **ORCH-05**:`
    - `- [ ] **ORCH-06**:` → `- [x] **ORCH-06**:`
    - `- [ ] **ORCH-07**:` → `- [x] **ORCH-07**:`

    **Section: Traceability table**

    For each of the 7 ORCH rows in the traceability table, change the Status column from `Pending` to `Complete`:
    - Row `ORCH-01 | Phase 16 → 18 | Pending` → `ORCH-01 | Phase 16 → 18 | Complete`
    - (repeat for ORCH-02 through ORCH-07)

    **Section: Last updated comment at bottom**

    Update the last-updated line to reflect Phase 18 completion:
    - Current: `*Last updated: 2026-02-22 — ORCH-01–07 reassigned to Phase 18 (gap closure) per milestone audit*`
    - New: `*Last updated: 2026-02-22 — ORCH-01–07 verified and closed by Phase 18; v1.5 complete (25/25)*`

    Use the Edit tool for each individual change to preserve all other content exactly. Do not rewrite the file.

    **After all edits**, verify the result reads correctly by checking:
    - The Orchestration section has 7 `[x]` checkboxes
    - The traceability table shows all 7 ORCH rows with "Complete"
    - All other requirements (PARSE-*, CTX-*, ROUTE-*, COMPAT-*, TEST-*) remain unchanged
  </action>
  <verify>
    1. No unchecked ORCH requirements remain: `grep "- \[ \] \*\*ORCH" .planning/REQUIREMENTS.md` (expect: no output)
    2. All 7 ORCH requirements checked: `grep -c "\- \[x\] \*\*ORCH" .planning/REQUIREMENTS.md` (expect: 7)
    3. Traceability table updated: `grep "ORCH-01.*Complete" .planning/REQUIREMENTS.md` (expect: 1 match)
    4. All other requirements unchanged: `grep "- \[ \]" .planning/REQUIREMENTS.md` (expect: no output — all v1.5 reqs complete)
    5. Total checked reqs: `grep -c "\- \[x\]" .planning/REQUIREMENTS.md` (expect: 25 — all v1.5 requirements)
  </verify>
  <done>
    REQUIREMENTS.md shows:
    - All 7 ORCH checkboxes checked (`[x]`)
    - All 7 ORCH traceability rows show Status: Complete
    - 25/25 v1.5 requirements satisfied (zero unchecked `[ ]` in the requirements section)
    - All other requirements (PARSE, CTX, ROUTE, COMPAT, TEST) remain unchanged
  </done>
</task>

</tasks>

<verification>
1. `grep "- \[ \] \*\*ORCH" .planning/REQUIREMENTS.md` — returns nothing (no unchecked ORCH reqs)
2. `grep -c "\- \[x\] \*\*ORCH" .planning/REQUIREMENTS.md` — returns 7
3. `grep -c "| Complete" .planning/REQUIREMENTS.md` — returns at least 7 (ORCH rows in traceability table)
4. `grep "- \[ \]" .planning/REQUIREMENTS.md` — returns nothing (all v1.5 reqs complete)
</verification>

<success_criteria>
Requirements traceability is closed when:
- All 7 ORCH requirement checkboxes are checked in REQUIREMENTS.md
- All 7 ORCH traceability rows show Status: Complete
- No unchecked requirements remain in the v1.5 section
- v1.5 effectively shows 25/25 satisfied (no [ ] remaining)
- The milestone audit re-run would show all ORCH requirements satisfied
</success_criteria>

<output>
After completion, create `.planning/phases/18-phase16-verification-closure/18-02-SUMMARY.md`
</output>
